        <h1>Hello World! 🌎 My name is <span>Christian Edward</span>.<img src="images/IMG_4503.jpg" height="auto" width="400"/> I am a Graphic Designer from Dutch-Indonesian descent 🇳🇱 🇮🇩, currently residing in Amsterdam (NL), where i live with a cat and 3 other people in a canal house 🌆. I am holding a BA degree in Autonomous Design (Fine Art Dept.) at the Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam (NL) where i graduated in 2016. I was born on May 4th 1987 on a Monday at 9am, which makes my zodiac sign a Taurus ♉, this unfortunately makes me incompatible with Aquarius, Leo, or Sagittarius star signs. According to my mother this is false information tough. In my free time
            i like to train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu🥋 and MMA 🤼 🥊, like to go to Musea or Art exhibitions 🖼️, listen to (or preferably watch) podcasts🎙️, and browse the Internet 🌐 for random Youtube tutorials on a daily basis, it is one of my absolute favourite things to do🕵️‍♂️. Furthermore, i currently am following this Coding Course to upgrade my developer skills and possibly changing carreers into the wonderful world of Tech👨‍💻. Thank you for reading up until this point, i hope to one day use it as my Ted Talk.</h1>
